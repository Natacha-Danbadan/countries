## My process
I  used Tailwind CSS for the layout of the page and using dom manipulation, i used javascript to populate the page and i also added load screen which a user sees on the screen while the data is yet to be displayed. I also used local storage to save a user's preferred mode (either light or dark). There is also a back button that enables a user go back to a previous page. There's is also a search function that enables a user search for a particular country and gets the various countries containing the keyword.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework
- Javascript


### What I learned

This is my first project done with Tailwind CSS. I got to broaden my skillset as i have only worked with Bootstrap before now and this enabled me get acquainted with Tailwind CSS. I also got implement a search function as well as a back button that enables a user go back to a previous page.

Also, i got to implement a load screen which a user sees on the screen while the data is yet to be displayed.
